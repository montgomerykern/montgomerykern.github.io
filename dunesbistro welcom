At the Dunes Bistro we have taken to do things a bit differently for our guests. Everything will be specialized to be local. We are an exclusive casual fine dining restaurant. We will be procuring our seafood fresh from the local docks of Murrells Inlet South Carolina. We will be sourcing all of our Beef from one of the best local suppliers and farmers in the Great State of South Carolina. Great Prices coupled with excellent customer service and amazing entertainment will gladly entice you make Dunes Bistro your local restaurant and bar.

Service industry friends will enjoy late night happy hour drinks and food. Since we know the hard work that you do.

Thank you for giving us a chance to be your host away from home.
